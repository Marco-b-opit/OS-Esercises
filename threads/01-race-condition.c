//? why? Each thread is given a timeslice to run,
//? and if its timeslice expires or it blocks
//? (for example, while waiting on an I/O operation),
//? the scheduler will pause its execution and allow another thread to run.
//? This preemptive multitasking is why even if you join the threads later,
//? while they're running concurrently, the specific sequence of operations
//? (like reading, incrementing, and writing back the counter) can be
//? interrupted and interleaved with other threads.
//? That interleaving results in some threads stopping and waiting for CPU time,
//? and itâ€™s precisely this lack of atomicity in the operations that causes the race condition.
